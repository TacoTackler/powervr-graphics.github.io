{"name":"PowerVR Graphics Native SDK","tagline":"C++ cross-platform 3D graphics SDK.

The SDK includes optimized example applications to demonstrate the most efficient ways of implementing common 3D graphics effects on PowerVR graphics cores. It also includes a cross-platform OS and graphics API abstraction layer, and a library of helper code for resource loading, vector and matrix maths, text printing and more.\r\n\r\nThe SDK supports iOS, Android and Linux PowerVR devices. It also supports Windows, OS X and Linux PC emulation. Imagination's OpenGL ES emulation library, PVRVFrame, can be downloaded from our website [here](http://community.imgtec.com/developers/powervr/tools/pvrvframe/).\r\n\r\n## About the SDK ##\r\n### Framework ###\r\nThe PowerVR Graphics SDK provides a framework which is made up of PVRShell and PVRTools. PVRShell is a simple, light-weight architecture for the barebones of application setup, shutdown and event handling. It is designed to streamline the process of writing cross-platform graphics applications. PVRTools, on the other hand, is a cross-platform tools library containing the most commonly used functionality in a 3D graphics application.\r\n\r\n### Example Applications ###\r\nThe examples provided in the SDK are fully commented, highly optimized C++ applications that cover a variety of rendering techniques. They are designed in a step-by-step tutorial style to gradually guide the most inexperienced graphics developers from a simple render of a single triangle to complex scenes that incorporate many objects, animations and shader effects.\r\n\r\n## Setup ##\r\nThe Getting Started guide of our SDK Browser provides step-by-step instructions to build and deploy the SDK example applications for the various support operating systems. You can find the SDK Browser here.\r\n\r\n## Documentation ##\r\nOur documentation (architecture guides, performance recommendations & white papers) can be found on the Imagination website [here](http://community.imgtec.com/developers/powervr/documentation/).\r\n\r\n## Support ##\r\nIf you have any questions about the SDK, PowerVR device optimization/debugging or our tools, please contact us through our [public forum](http://forum.imgtec.com/categories/powervr-graphics). We also recommend checking out our [FAQ](forum.imgtec.com/categories/powervr-faq) to see if your question has already been answered.\r\nIf you would prefer to contact us confidentially, you can file a support ticket [here](https://pvrsupport.imgtec.com/new-ticket).\r\n\r\n## License ##\r\nThe SDK is distributed under a permissive licence so it can easily be integrated into commercial and non-commercial applications. You can find the license [here](https://github.com/powervr-graphics/Native_SDK/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
